<p>description</p>
<p>This tunnel appeared in my world, and some kind of white block was at the center of it.</p>
<p>Then my game crashed — but that’s not all.</p>
<p>My world got corrupted, but I had a backup. Everything in the world was unchanged and exactly the same…</p>
<p> except for the tunnel. It wasn’t there anymore.</p>
<p>I dug into the world files because this was simply impossible.There’s no way the backup saved everything except that tunnel.</p>
<p>What I found was insane. There were broken, unreadable playerdata backups and structures that the game tried to read at the exact moment I was inside the tunnel</p>
<p>One problem, though: I can’t figure out where those backups even came from.</p>
<p>So, in short, I have absolutely no idea what just happened.— stoneguy308</p>
